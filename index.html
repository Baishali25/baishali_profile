                <p>
                    Hey, I'm Baishali, a B.Tech Computer Science student at SRM University. Passionate about tech and
                    innovation, I specialize in Java, Python, and C++. Recently, I worked on projects like the Banking
                    Management System, refining my coding and problem-solving skills.
                    <br>
                <h2>Academic Journey:-</h2>
                I graduated from S.K.M. public School with a strong foundation in mathematics and sciences, laying the
                groundwork for my current pursuits in computer science.
                <br>
                <h2>Hobbies:- </h2>
                Beyond coding, I find joy in [mention a hobby or two, e.g., reading, hiking, or playing a musical
                instrument]. These activities not only provide a refreshing break but also contribute to my holistic
                development.
                <br>
                <h2>Coding Competitions:-</h2>
                Outside of class, you'll often find me immersed in coding competitions and hackathons, where I enjoy the
                thrill of solving challenges under tight deadlines. These experiences not only sharpen my skills but
                also expose me to diverse problem-solving approaches.
                <br>
                <h2>
                    Future Focus:-</h2>
                    Eager to contribute my skills to real-world impact, I'm particularly interested in the realms of
                    Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Exploring the potential of these technologies to
                    address complex problems is a key focus of my academic and personal endeavors.
